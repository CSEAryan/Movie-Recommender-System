# Movie-Recommender-System
This Movie Recommender System is a Streamlit-based web app that suggests 5 similar movies based on user input. The recommendations are generated using a precomputed similarity matrix, which is stored in a pickle file. The app also fetches movie posters using The Movie Database (TMDb) API to enhance the user experience.
